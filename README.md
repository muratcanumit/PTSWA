KADIR HAS UNIVERSITY HELP DESK DEVICE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM
( Product Technical Survelliance Web Application )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



AIM
---------------------------
Help Desk Device Surveillance System for Kadir Has University is needed to reduce the high density of working and being in dialog with students, academics and executive staffs which can be unnecessary.

HDDSS is planned as a web application because of the increasing trends of Cloud Computing Sector and related tools of it, also people have been respect more and more in recent years to the internet and internet applications such as on-line banking, e-commerce, on-line shopping and many various sorts of this type of concepts. In classical term, HDDSS-like programs are mostly running on desktop and operating system programs. It costs to the systems with large database programs, high performance hardware and authentication insecurness. However, the virtual hosting technology is more secure, faster, has availability and usability because of the internet technologies, if the optimum source is provided. Database systems have high performance and ease of use on the virtual hosting.

As a result, HDDSS is a surveillance system that runs on the virtual host and have a light database and structure. However, it is faster and more functional web application.

 


METHODS, TOOLS AND GUIDES
---------------------------
Help Desk Device Surveillance System is developed in a software development life cycle. Firstly, requirements of the project are defined according to the project functions, then tools and methods are chosen. After database designing, analysis of the project is completed. According to the analysis, back-end of the HDDSS is started to developing on Ubuntu-Linux operating system and front-end of the HDDSS is started to developing on Microsoft Windows 8 operating system, then front-end applications are transported when they are completed to the Ubuntu to merge front-end and back-end of the HDDSS.

In the implementation phase, Python programming language and Django Web Development Framework is used while developing the back-end of HDDSS. All applications are created and developed that using a text editor which is named Sublime Text 2 editor in an Virtual Environment.

Bootstrap Web Front-End Framework is chosen to develop the front-end of the HDDSS and Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 is the chosen text editor of the project. Front-end files are transported and merged to the back-end on Ubuntu at the forward phases.

GitHub is used for the revisioning of the HDDSS. GitHub processes applied on Ubuntu Terminal (Command Line on Shell) to the repository of the project. Guake Terminal is chosen to be able to faster while developing the project at the terminal side.

IPython is used in project to get more efficient on shell while testing and querying objects and codes.

Ipdb is used in project to debug when an error occurred.

Heroku is chosen and used to deploy project on a virtual hosting and serving the www.khashelpdesk.com .

PEP8 is used to make codes in good quality and also make them appear more specific.

To sum up, aim of using all of these is that make the project development is more stable, faster, correctly and quality.

 

FUNCTIONS OF PROJECT
---------------------------
Help Desk Device Surveillance System is designed for Kadir Has University Help Desk Personnel ( will be mentioned as admins) and the students, academics, executive personnel and the other people (will be mentioned as users) in the Kadir Has University.

Admin-url of the HDDSS is www.khashelpdesk.com/admin to used by Help Desk Personnel, user-url of the HDDSS is www.khashelpdesk.com to used by the device owners.

Admins of  HDDSS are separated in 2 types. First type is Super user of  HDDSS admins.  Super user have all the permissions in HDDSS. These permissions are,

·         Can log in and log out the system,

·         Can create admins,

·         Can add, edit, search, monitor and delete admins,

·         Can edit permissions of admins,

·         Can add new devices,

·         Can edit, search, filter, monitor and delete devices,

Second type of Admins are User Admins who can also have these features depends on the permissions of given to them by Super user.

Users of  HDDSS do not have the permissions of admins. They can only search their device and monitor them. Users have an email from the HDDSS while the device is recorded to the system, and they use the surveillance key of device which is sent by system to search on the client side of the HDDSS. When they use the key and search the device, HDDSS serves a page that contains the information of their devices which are left at the Kadir Has University Help Desk. These information include the device’s type, brand and model names of device, record

HDDSS has a simple mechanism. HDDSS serves a simple and basic look of the system and processes about devices to admins, it has ease of use for them. HDDSS generates a surveillance key which is unique for all devices which can be different type of all devices for users. The surveillance key is generated when the device is recorded to the system and sent by email to the device owner’s email address.

Admins record the devices with the device type, serial number, brand and model names of device, problem, current status which is “at technical service “ option at first record of the device, device owner’s name and last name, phone number, email address and KHAS ID at first record. There is also a delivery date at recording but at first stage, this is not required, also some of the information of the device are not required. Lastly, record date of device is auto generated by HDDSS and saved while recording the device.

Type of device, problem of device, current status, device owner’s name, last name and email address are required. Others are depends on the users and devices.

Admins can record the devices’ serial numbers with a barcode reader device to the system. Thus, the admins do not lose any time with typing on the keyboard the serial number of device and also they can use barcode reader while searching the device by serial number on the admin panel.

When admins make change on the device at the current status information, HDDSS sends an email to inform the user about the device status.  When the process of device is completed on the Help Desk, admins can update device as “ready to delivery” option or close the device process with editing the device’s current status as “delivered” option. HDDSS informs the users about their devices at all changes on device status information.

Admins can make search on the admin panel with the surveillance key of device, serial number, owner’s name and last name, brand and model name. They also can filtered the devices by record date filter. That filter has 5 options that any date, today, past 7 days, this month and this year.  Devices’ current status filter has 4 options that all devices, at technical service, ready to delivery and delivered. Also there is the device type filter that include the device types.
